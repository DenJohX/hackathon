# Planet of Heroes
==================

We know that in the world there are many problems to be solved, just as there are many people interested in helping others in need, they usually do not know how to do it, so we want to create an application that will help create social conscience about the problems our planet faces, using a web platform that shows a map and highlights the most problematic countries; Once you've learned the situations of each country or city you can help an initiative in the city you prefer you through a financial donation or being part of a team of volunteers.


We belive crowfounding social initiatives should not be only about the money,
it should be about volunteers and reuning people to solve problems.


We believe that supporting our knowledge in this area will help our planet but especially to bring this project to reality begin to combat problems such as extreme poverty, as Guatemalans know very well but little is being done to eradicate it. That's why we ask you to become a hero allowing to actually carry this platform is part of WORLD OF HEROES!!.
